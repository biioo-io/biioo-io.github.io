###### Custom Themes

If you don't want the default site colors, you can create custom themes for the site in the [mdl theme creator](http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html). The site will create a custom css, something like this:

     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/code.getmdl.io/1.0.0/material.teal-green.min.css" />

Now add this in the _includes/head.html file, under the main css and enjoy your new theme.

###### Post Options
